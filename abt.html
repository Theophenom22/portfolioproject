  <!-- ABOUT SECTION -->
<p class="txt">Hello world,welcome to my page,all you need to know about the About section of a page. 
<h1 class="abt-head">What is an About Us page?</h1>
An About Us page is a section on a website that provides information about a company, organization, or individual. It’s an opportunity to tell your brand’s story, share your vision or mission, introduce team members, and outline your history and achievements. This is where you build trust and credibility with customers.

In Shopify’s customer trust research, we found shoppers navigate to an About Us page to learn more about the brand and the people behind the products. According to one study, 59% of consumers surveyed said they would more likely purchase from a brand they trust. That number jumps to 79% of younger Gen Z consumers. Your About Page should address those two curiosities shoppers have to help them with decision making.

Shoppers are also interested in a company’s mission and brand values. They’ll use the About Us page to determine if they share core values with the business and to decide if they want to shop with you or not. Shared values, especially related to ethical and sustainable business practices, continue to drive consumer decision making.

<h1 class="abt-head">Components of an About Us page</h1>
In contrast to a landing page, your About Us page should focus more on your brand identity and less on sales.

Here are some components to include in an About Us page:

<h1 class="abt-head">Your brand story</h1>
Tell shoppers the origin story of your business and why you started it. For the most impact, make it memorable and personal, so customers relate and connect with your brand. If your brand is your name or it was formed based on a personal brand, your company’s story can be one and the same with your founder story.

 <h1 class="abt-head">Who you serve</h1>
What do you offer and who is it for? Help shoppers see the value of your product or service by sharing how it solves problems or meets different needs. This is known as your unique selling proposition.

 <h1 class="abt-head">How you operate</h1>
If you offer a service, explain your business model or how your products are made. If you have a unique way of doing things, show it. This builds credibility with shoppers and helps you stand out against competitors.

<h1 class="abt-head">The face of your business </h1>
Feature photos of the founders or key people on your team. Customers like to see who they are buying from or working with. This can also include behind-the-scenes shots of your work space, studio, or retail store.

<h1 class="abt-head">Persuasive content </h1>
Consider what step you’d like readers to take next. Use additional content and calls to action (CTAs) to move them forward towards that goal. This could include buttons, testimonials, an explainer video, data visualizations, links to blog posts, products, your social media accounts or newsletter.

Your About Us page is going to be about you, but that doesn’t mean you can’t borrow some ideas from others, especially when it comes to structure and design.

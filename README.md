## Technologies used

## What I learned
I learnt how to use external icons from the internet via linking

## Challanges faced
I faced some issues when trying to add icons from remix icons but i was able to rectify it using the cdn link which i omitted before, you can get the cdn code on the remix.icon website and follow 
i did on the code to get each link for various icon, simply search for the icon you need and copy the cdn e.g; i class="ri-whatsapp-fill"/i for whatspp

# Project Portfolio
This code contains HTML and CSS code you can use to create a portfolio for yourself or business

## Technologies used
I used visual studio code as my code editor and advice you do so because of its extension, i also used remix.icon for my icons

## What I learned
I learnt how to use external icons from the internet via linking

## Challanges faced
I faced some issues when trying to add icons from remix icons but i was able to rectify it using the cdn link which i omitted before, you can get the cdn code on the remix.icon website and follow 
i did on the code to get each link for various icon, simply search for the icon you need and copy the cdn e.g; i class="ri-whatsapp-fill"/i for whatspp
Another challege i faced was updating my codes on my github account directly from my VS code using GIT bash, i tried uploading it using the terminal but it did'nt work because
I did not initially push my codes originally from VS code, so after watching some youtube videos and ChatGPT i was able to push it forcefully but it overwrote all my previous 
folders and file on my repository so i had to write another read me text

# portfolioproject
This repository contains code to create a personal portfolio for your self or business

## Technologies used
VS code was my primary code editor for making my portfolio page and I highly recommend you use it also because of it's extension which can be useful in the future 

## What I learned 
While coding i learned a couple of things i didn't know before like adding a table and logo icons from remixicon.com

## Challenges faced
One of the challenges I faced with be adding icons but i overcame that. To add icons from the internet visit remixicon.com and copy the cdn on your link tag in vs code, you'll see that on the 
head tag of my code and copy what i did
